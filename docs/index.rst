Votelib documentation
=====================

Votelib is a package to evaluate results of elections under various systems.
It aims to provide reliable implementations of many voting systems so that
they may be evaluated as they are used in real-world conditions and compared.
The primary focus is on political decision making, but the library is not
limited to evaluating political decisions only.

More can be learned by looking at the examples of usage below or at the
API reference.
